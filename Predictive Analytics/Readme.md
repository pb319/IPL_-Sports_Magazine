## Orange Cap:
#### _Objective_: 
- To predict the player having maximum total run in the IPL season 2024.

#### _Methodologies_: 
- Assumptions like linear realationship, Independence of errors, Autocorrelation, Normality of errors has been checked
- Primary model has been made through Stepwise Regression method
- Multicollinearity of independent variable has been identified by Variance Information Factor
- Multicollinearity of independent variable has been addressed by Principal Component Analysis
- Test of Significance has been considered while model building
- Reliability has been reconfirmed by R-Squared and Adjusted R-Squred
